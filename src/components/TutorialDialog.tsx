                Before diving into specifics, here&apos;s the typical workflow:
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>1. Location Setup:</strong> Define your play area using
                preset locations or custom polygon drawing
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>2. Question Creation:</strong> Add and configure the 5
                question types (Radius, Thermometer, Tentacles, Matching,
                Measuring)
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>3. Sharing:</strong> Share the questions and game
                boundaries with other players
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>4. Hider Mode:</strong> Let the hider automatically
                answer questions based on their location
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>5. Zone Analysis:</strong> View potential hiding zones
                and their constraints
                <br />
                <br />
                Let&apos;s explore each step in detail!

                &ldquo;holes&rdquo; in your play area by excluding specific
                regions. Perfect for removing water bodies, restricted areas, or
                creating complex boundaries.
                <br />

                <strong>Polygon Tool:</strong> Draw custom boundaries that

                shapes or when preset locations don&apos;t quite fit your needs.
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Drawing Tips:</strong>
                <br />• Click to start, continue clicking to add points
                <br />• Click the first point again to close the polygon
                <br />• Use multiple polygons to create complex areas
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Use Cases:</strong> University campuses, specific
                neighborhoods, custom game boundaries, or areas that cross
                multiple administrative regions.

                <br />
                <strong>OpenStreetMap (OSM) Foundation:</strong>
                <br />• All geographic data comes from OpenStreetMap
                <br />• Community-driven mapping with varying completeness
                <br />• Generally excellent in urban areas, more sparse in rural
                regions
                <br />• Data quality depends on local mapping community activity
                <br />• Updated regularly but may lag behind real-world changes

                <br />
                <strong>Administrative Boundaries:</strong>
                <br />• Official government boundaries imported from
                authoritative sources
                <br />• High accuracy for major administrative divisions
                <br />• Simplified to ±100 meters for browser performance
                <br />• Some disputed or changing boundaries may be outdated
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Transportation Data:</strong>
                <br />• Train stations: Good coverage in developed regions
                <br />• Commercial airports: Limited to those with IATA codes
                <br />• High-speed rail: Covers major systems (Shinkansen, TGV,
                etc.)
                <br />• Business data (McDonald&apos;s, 7-Eleven) depends on

                <br />
                <strong>Points of Interest:</strong>
                <br />• Museums, hospitals, cinemas: Urban bias in coverage
                <br />• Theme parks, zoos: Major attractions well-represented
                <br />• Libraries, golf courses, mountains: Completeness varies
                by region
                <br />• Always verify critical locations for your specific area
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Coordinate Accuracy:</strong>
                <br />• Distance calculations use geodesic formulas
                <br />• Accounts for Earth&apos;s curvature and ellipsoid shape
                <br />• Typical accuracy within 1-2 meters for positioning
                <br />• Coastline data accuracy approximately ±100 meters
                <br />• Administrative boundary simplification may affect
                precision
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Performance Limitations:</strong>
                <br />• Large datasets may cause browser slowdowns
                <br />• Memory usage increases with game area size
                <br />• Complex polygons simplified for rendering performance
                <br />• API rate limits may affect real-time data loading
                <br />• Mobile devices have additional memory constraints

                <br />✓ Analyze results
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Master the Five Question Types:</strong>
                <br />• <strong>Radius:</strong> Distance-based circles
                (inside/outside)
                <br />• <strong>Thermometer:</strong> Relative distance
                comparison (warmer/colder)
                <br />• <strong>Tentacles:</strong> Specific location
                identification by category
                <br />• <strong>Matching:</strong> Property comparison (same
                zone, nearest airport, etc...)
                <br />• <strong>Measuring:</strong> Distance comparison relative
                to seekers
                <br />
